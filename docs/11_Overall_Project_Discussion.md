This project combines multiple cutting-edge technologies (RL, CV, NLP, and IoT) to build a robot car that is autonomous, intelligent, and interactive. It addresses real-world problems such as road safety, driver convenience, and smart home integration. With a structured timeline and realistic milestones, this project is both ambitious and achievable, offering our team an opportunity to deepen our expertise in AI/ML, IoT, and robotics while contributing to the development of next-generation technology.
The project caused the group members to significantly extend our skill sets. Throughout the development, we learned how to implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms, integrate computer vision techniques, use prompt engineering for NLP tasks and build IoT systems for remote control. This hands-on experience helped us gain proficiency in multiple technologies that we had not previously worked with.

### IoT

This project significantly broadened our team’s technical skill set. Throughout development, we gained hands-on experience with building complete IoT systems—from hardware integration and real-time data communication to cloud-based infrastructure and mobile application development. Setting up and tuning the KY-037 sound sensor taught us the importance of signal conditioning, hardware sensitivity, and edge detection in embedded systems. Working with MQTT brokers on the Raspberry Pi deepened our understanding of lightweight messaging protocols and thread-safe event handling in Python. Furthermore, manually constructing MQTT packets within Godot forced us to learn about low-level networking, socket communication, and protocol specifications—skills not typically covered in high-level app development.
Integrating AWS IoT Core added another layer of complexity, challenging us to understand cloud authentication via X.509 certificates, secure TLS connections, and MQTT policy management. These efforts enhanced our team's confidence in deploying secure, internet-accessible IoT solutions. Beyond technical implementation, we also improved our ability to troubleshoot hardware issues, manage real-world noise in sensor data, and refine user experience through iterative testing. Overall, the project not only helped us master a diverse range of technologies but also taught us how to approach and solve complex, system-level problems collaboratively.

### Reinforcement Learning

This project significantly expanded our knowledge and skills in reinforcement learning and IoT embedded system design. As we developed the autonomous vehicle, we gained hands-on experience implementing and tuning RL algorithms such as Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). We learned how to structure the environment into meaningful states, define an effective action space, and shape reward functions to encourage strategic behavior. Implementing online learning in a real-time physical system deepened our understanding of how reinforcement learning differs in practice from simulation-based experiments.

We also explored techniques like experience replay and neural network-based Q-value approximation, gaining insight into the challenges of stabilizing learning in dynamic environments. Integrating the RL logic with GPIO-based motor control, ultrasonic sensors, and optional camera input helped us bridge the gap between theory and real-world deployment. This hands-on process improved not only our technical proficiency in Python, NumPy, and PyTorch, but also our ability to debug hardware-software interaction and design systems that learn and adapt over time, even on resource-constrained platforms like the Raspberry Pi.

### Natural Language Procession

The natural language processing (NLP) component of our project significantly expanded our team's skill set in both depth and breadth. Before this project, many of us had limited exposure to real-world applications of NLP beyond textbook examples or basic chatbot exercises. However, through our work integrating voice input, prompt engineering, and LLM interactions, we gained practical experience designing conversational systems that required tight coupling between language understanding and physical execution. This challenged us to think beyond static inputs and outputs, and instead design flexible prompts, create fallback strategies, and handle ambiguity in human language.

We became familiar with essential Python libraries such as SpeechRecognition, PyAudio, requests, and OpenAI Python, as well as RESTful API design using FastAPI and Flask. Importantly, we learned how to structure prompts to optimize LLM responses, tune system behavior with regex-based command parsing, and switch between cloud and local inference based on performance constraints. This not only enhanced our understanding of NLP pipelines but also exposed us to real-world engineering considerations like latency, error handling, and resource allocation on embedded systems.

Moreover, working directly with large language models—both commercial ones like GPT-4 and open-source models—provided us valuable insight into the power and limitations of different LLM architectures. It helped us appreciate the trade-offs between accessibility, performance, and computational cost. The process of integrating LLMs into a robotic platform also highlighted how crucial it is for language interfaces to be tightly integrated with system logic in order to enable meaningful, contextual, and safe interactions. In short, the NLP aspect of this project not only taught us the technical skills needed to work with modern language models, but also gave us a deeper appreciation for the challenges involved in making machines understand and respond to human language in the real world.

### Computer Vision

The project significantly expanded our technical capabilities in the domain of computer vision. Prior to this, most of the team had limited exposure to vision systems, but the hands-on process of integrating object detection, OCR, and natural language processing allowed us to develop a practical understanding of how machines interpret visual input. We learned to work with key libraries such as OpenCV for image manipulation and analysis, Tesseract for optical character recognition, and how to interface these components with NLP systems to generate meaningful responses based on visual stimuli. This experience bridged the gap between abstract machine learning theory and real-world perception-based robotics.

Moreover, we encountered and overcame real hardware challenges that are often absent in simulation-based learning environments. Debugging camera module crashes, optimizing image processing on limited hardware like the Raspberry Pi 4, and creating fallback strategies for vision failures taught us not only how to build systems—but how to maintain and troubleshoot them under real-world constraints. This forced us to think critically about performance optimization, robustness, and modular design.

We also explored how computer vision can be used to enhance learning systems, particularly in reinforcement learning. This opened up new avenues of exploration for us, as we started developing the framework for a vision-assisted self-driving agent that can learn from visual cues in its environment—such as lane markings, obstacles, or even signs—rather than relying purely on distance sensors. Working at the intersection of computer vision, RL, and IoT pushed us to think across disciplines and consider how perception, action, and reasoning can be unified in an intelligent agent. Overall, the project not only improved our technical proficiency but also matured our engineering mindset, giving us a well-rounded foundation to pursue more advanced AI and robotics applications in the future.

## INNOVATION

The project is innovative in both concept and execution. The idea of combining RL, CV, NLP, and IoT into a single, unified robotic car is novel, and we adopted a unique approach to integrate these technologies. By leveraging Reinforcement Learning instead of traditional rule-based systems, we were able to create an autonomous vehicle that learns and improves over time. This innovation not only contributes to our knowledge but also has the potential to advance research in autonomous systems.

Additionally, the project brings something entirely new into the students' lives by bridging the gap between AI/ML technologies and practical IoT applications. 

### IoT

This project introduced a unique and practical innovation into our lives by transforming theoretical IoT concepts into a fully functioning remote home automation system. While IoT is often discussed in abstract or large-scale industrial contexts, our system brought it down to a human scale—giving us firsthand experience with how everyday objects like lights can become smarter, responsive, and more accessible through sensor integration and remote control. The dual approach—using local MQTT communication for fast, Wi-Fi-based control and extending to AWS IoT Core for full internet-based remote access—gave us insight into the architecture behind both edge and cloud-connected IoT systems.

What made the project especially innovative was the combination of sound-based interaction with smart plugs and cloud services—merging tangible human actions like clapping with backend technologies like secure MQTT messaging and remote/mobile interface design. It demonstrated how physical and digital systems can work in harmony, paving the way for more intuitive smart home experiences. Most importantly, it shifted our perspective on what IoT can be: not just a buzzword, but a powerful tool for building interactive, user-centric technologies that improve everyday living.

### Reinforcement Learning

This project introduced an entirely new dimension of innovation by bridging the gap between cutting-edge reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and real-world robotics. Unlike traditional ML applications that operate on static datasets, we built a self-improving system that learned directly from its physical environment in real time. This fusion of RL with embedded IoT hardware pushed us to innovate at every level—from designing quantized state representations for low-power devices, to creating efficient persistence mechanisms that preserved learning progress across sessions. By deploying RL algorithms like Q-learning and DQN on a Raspberry Pi-powered robotic car, we brought abstract AI concepts to life in a tangible and impactful way. 

Our implementation of online learning allowed the car to adapt on the fly, while reward shaping and experience replay added layers of sophistication typically seen only in advanced research. This project not only gave us the opportunity to build something novel but also demonstrated the real-world potential of reinforcement learning in autonomous systems, especially when resource constraints require creative algorithmic design and optimization.

### Natural Language Processing

The natural language processing (NLP) component of our project introduced a powerful and innovative dimension to our understanding of how human-computer interaction can be reimagined through AI. By enabling our robotic platform, KITT, to listen, interpret, and respond to spoken language, we bridged a gap between abstract machine learning technologies and tangible, real-world robotics. This integration transformed a traditional command-driven IoT device into a more intuitive, conversational assistant capable of understanding context, tone, and intent—something rarely seen in embedded systems projects at our level.

This innovation goes far beyond just adding voice control. We leveraged cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to interpret complex, open-ended prompts and generate intelligent responses. This pushed our team to think creatively about prompt engineering, real-time interaction, and safe execution of AI-generated instructions. We also developed a modular architecture that allowed the NLP system to collaborate with other subsystems—like GPIO control, TTS, and computer vision—enabling KITT to not only hear and respond, but to see, interpret, and act based on natural language alone.

What made this especially novel was our hybrid approach: the use of both cloud-based LLMs and locally hosted open-source models. This dual backend provided both flexibility and resilience in our system design and exposed us to the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and computational limits. In doing so, we moved beyond theoretical understanding of NLP into a domain where language models directly influence the behavior of physical systems. This project showed us firsthand how the fusion of NLP and IoT opens the door to more intelligent, accessible, and user-friendly technology—a lesson that will undoubtedly shape our approach to future innovation.

### Computer Vision

The integration of computer vision into our project introduced a level of innovation that fundamentally changed how we view and interact with AI in physical environments. For most of us, computer vision had previously existed only as an abstract concept in lecture slides or in datasets like MNIST or COCO. Through this project, we had the opportunity to bring those concepts to life—enabling a robotic agent to see, interpret, and speak about the real world in real time. This fusion of perception and language introduced a unique form of interaction where the car could not only navigate but also describe its environment, giving a human-like touch to a traditionally mechanical system.

The novelty of combining OCR and object detection with NLP was particularly exciting. For example, seeing KITT capture an image, identify a tissue box in front of it, and say “I see a tissue box” using speech synthesis felt like a scene out of science fiction, yet it was rooted in actual implementation. This synthesis of vision and language pipelines is the same type of multimodal integration that powers advanced systems like Tesla’s Autopilot—albeit on a much smaller and student-accessible scale.

What made this innovative wasn't just the technology itself, but the context: we did it on limited hardware, with limited resources, and still managed to achieve early signs of IoT embedded intelligence. The experience allowed us to appreciate the real-world challenges in building intelligent systems—such as latency, instability of hardware connections, and computational limitations—but also the incredible potential of even small-scale computer vision to transform an agent’s ability to understand and react to its world. This project didn’t just teach us how computer vision works; it gave us a hands-on glimpse of the future of intelligent, perceptual machines.

## SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

This project not only fulfilled our initial goals but also opened new avenues for innovation and continuous learning.

### IoT

This IoT project successfully demonstrated a practical and user-friendly remote home automation system focused on controlling bedroom lighting through sound-based commands and a mobile application. By integrating a KY-037 sound sensor with a Raspberry Pi-based MQTT communication framework, we enabled local real-time interaction using simple claps.

Additionally, we expanded the system’s capabilities to support global access via AWS IoT Core, allowing remote control from any location with internet access. The dual-mode functionality provided both low-latency local control and cloud-connected convenience, highlighting the versatility of modern IoT systems.

Throughout development and testing, we encountered several real-world challenges, such as sensor sensitivity, ambient noise interference, Wi-Fi reliability, and the complexity of handling secure cloud connections. These issues prompted us to experiment with threshold tuning, improve mobile app reliability, and gain deeper insights into network infrastructure requirements. The project emphasized that even simple IoT solutions demand careful consideration of hardware quality, robust communication protocols, and real-world variability. Overall, this project deepened our understanding of IoT as a convergence of hardware, networking, and software design, and showcased its potential to create smarter and more responsive living environments.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. In this project, we implemented both tabular Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to enable a Raspberry Pi-controlled robotic vehicle to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles. The agent learned by trial and error, continuously updating its decision-making strategy based on real-time sensor input and the outcomes of its actions.

We employed a discretized state space for Q-learning using binned ultrasonic sensor readings, while DQN utilized continuous inputs, including raw distance data and optionally visual input. Actions were defined as discrete motor commands, and the reward structure was carefully crafted to promote strategic navigation behavior. Online learning allowed the system to adapt in real time, while persistence mechanisms ensured the model’s knowledge was preserved across sessions.

This hands-on application of RL demonstrated its practical challenges and potential—especially in embedded systems with limited resources. It required thoughtful design of state/action representations, reward shaping, and data handling, offering valuable insight into how RL algorithms can power intelligent decision-making in autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments.

### Natural Language Processing

The natural language processing (NLP) component served as the central intelligence of our system, transforming human speech into actionable robotic behavior. By combining speech recognition, prompt engineering, and large language models (LLMs), we enabled the robot to engage in meaningful two-way conversations, interpret user intent, and execute commands through physical interaction. SpeechRecognition and PyAudio libraries handled real-time voice input, which was then transcribed and structured into prompts tailored for LLMs like GPT-4. The returned responses were parsed into both text-to-speech outputs and physical actions executed via GPIO.

One of the most impactful aspects of this system was the use of LLMs not only to understand commands but also to inject natural, context-aware interactions. This allowed the robot to handle vague or ambiguous input more gracefully, offer clarifications, and maintain more human-like dialogue. The modular architecture also supported fallback strategies, switching between cloud and local models depending on latency and availability.

Despite the challenges of integrating resource-heavy LLMs with limited hardware like the Raspberry Pi, we found the NLP system to be both powerful and transformative. It added a new layer of interactivity, accessibility, and intelligence to the robot, and it demonstrated how conversational AI can be embedded into real-world applications. Our experience highlighted the importance of prompt design, the trade-offs between local and remote inference, and the potential of NLP to elevate traditional IoT systems into truly intelligent agents.

### Computer Vision

The computer vision (CV) component of our system marked an ambitious step toward giving our robotic assistant, KITT, the ability to perceive and understand the world visually. Our initial implementation focused on enabling two key capabilities: object description and optical character recognition (OCR). Using a 2-axis gimbal-mounted camera connected to the Raspberry Pi, we captured image frames which were then analyzed using pre-trained models from OpenCV and Tesseract OCR. These visual inputs were paired with natural language processing (NLP) so that KITT could describe what it saw in words or read textual content aloud.

Despite limited hardware resources and unstable physical connections between the camera and the Pi—which often resulted in crashes—we successfully demonstrated early-stage integration. We were able to capture and process at least one frame to describe an object and another where KITT used OCR to read a word. While simple, these accomplishments validated the core pipeline: image capture, visual analysis, and language synthesis. This integration forms a foundation for more advanced capabilities like scene understanding and visual navigation.

Our biggest technical hurdles included dealing with the Raspberry Pi’s constrained memory and CPU, especially when loading vision libraries or running multiple processes in parallel. These limitations restricted the frequency and resolution of captured frames, affecting real-time performance. However, the experience provided deep insight into how vision and language can work together in robotics and sparked future directions—especially in using vision to support reinforcement learning for self-driving behavior. Ultimately, this CV module elevated our project from a voice-controlled robot to an intelligent agent capable of perceiving and interpreting its environment.
