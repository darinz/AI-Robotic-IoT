# Documentation Index

Welcome to the documentation hub for the **AI-Robotic-IoT** project — an intelligent, autonomous, and conversational robotic car inspired by KITT from *Knight Rider*. This folder contains detailed technical documentation and project insights across all modules: IoT, Reinforcement Learning (RL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision (CV).

## Document Structure

## How to Use

You can navigate the documents in sequence to understand the complete lifecycle of the project—from conceptual motivation to technical execution and results. These markdown files serve as both a knowledge base and reference for future development.

For best results, view these files in a markdown viewer or IDE with markdown preview capabilities.

## Notes

- Files are numbered to suggest a logical reading order.
- Each file is standalone but contributes to the overall system understanding.
- As the project evolves, this documentation will be updated accordingly.
