# AI, Robotic, and IoT Project

> *“One person can make a difference.” – Knight Rider*

Welcome to the **AI, Robotic, and IoT Project**—a pioneering initiative at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Robotics**, and the **Internet of Things**. This repository unites advanced computing domains to create **KITT**, a smart, self-driving robot car capable of natural voice interaction, autonomous navigation, and IoT-based control.


## Demo

Experience KITT in action:

## Vision

This project offers a glimpse into the **future of intelligent transportation and smart living**, where machines not only think and act, but also **listen, understand, and respond**. By integrating Robotics, AI, and IoT, KITT exemplifies a truly interdisciplinary system that pushes the boundaries of what's possible.


## Core Modules

### IoT – Remote Home Automation & Control
- Control and monitor smart home devices via KITT
- Cloud or edge-based communication
- MQTT and HTTP protocol support

### RL – Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving
- RL algorithms for self-driving behavior optimization
- Simulated and real-world training environments
- Obstacle avoidance, path planning, and adaptive learning

### NLP – Voice-Based Command & Interaction
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech pipeline
- Command parsing using NLP
- Enables natural, hands-free interaction

### CV – Computer Vision for Perception
- Object detection, lane following, and environment mapping
- Real-time feedback for reinforcement learning
- Enhanced safety and decision-making
