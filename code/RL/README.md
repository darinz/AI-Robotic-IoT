# RL Module â€“ Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving

This module implements the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms used to teach KITT how to drive autonomously by learning from interaction with its environment.

## Key Concepts

- **Environment**: Simulated or physical driving setup with feedback mechanisms
- **Agent**: The driving policy that learns to optimize behavior
- **Reward Function**: Penalizes bad driving, rewards optimal behavior
- **Training Loop**: Continuous learning via trial and error

##  Contents

- Environment simulation files (OpenAI Gym-compatible)
- Core RL agent with policy and learning algorithm
- Training loop and checkpoint saving
- Script to test a trained policy

## Algorithms

* Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
* PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) \[Planned]
* Custom reward shaping

## Notes

* This module can be tested in simulation or with live video input from the robot
* Reward and environment configuration can be tuned

> Future versions will include transfer learning and more robust safety handling.
