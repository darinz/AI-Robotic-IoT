# IoT Module â€“ Smart Home Integration

This module handles the Internet of Things (IoT) functionality of the KITT robotic car. It allows the vehicle to interact with smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, and sensors, enabling remote control and automation from within the car.

## Features

- Remote control of smart home devices
- Support for MQTT or HTTP-based communication
- Device status monitoring and feedback loop
- Basic mobile or web interface integration

## Contents

- Script to send/receive MQTT commands to smart devices
- Example REST API interactions for smart home APIs
- Configuration file for device IPs, topics, and credentials
- UI components for controlling devices

## Notes

This module is modular and can work independently from the rest of the project. Integration with the robotic car allows it to issue commands based on location, user voice input, or preset conditions.

> More smart device integrations will be added in future updates.
